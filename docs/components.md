### Components

L0neGamer is building in the pull request 
https://github.com/aquarial/discord-haskell/pull/91

- add components support
- create a bunch of helper functions and types
- updating API to version 8
- adding some examples
- get it all working!

Still in a bit of limbo though. 
Bring it up in the project discord server
if you have thoughts to share
