### Debugging

Always print the userFacingError Text returned from `runDiscord`. I use this to record
errors that cannot be recovered from.

If something else goes wrong with the library please open an issue. It is helpful,
but not always necessary, to attach a log of what's going on when the library
crashes.

Assign a handler to the `discordOnLog :: Text -> IO ()` to print info as it happens.
